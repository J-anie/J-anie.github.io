    <h3><a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/eastbio-priming-in-humans-and-language-models/?p161659">Structural Priming: comparing language models and the human mind</a></h3>
      <p>This is a collaborative project between the Computer Science and Psychology Departments in the University of Aberdeen. The key purpose of this study is to compare syntactic priming effects generated by human participants to that in AI systems that model language processing (e.g. Large Language Models - LLMs). We plan to understand the extent to which LLMs behave similarly to humans when comprehending structure in language, and whether resulting activation and prediction patterns are similar. Project collaborators: Dr Arabella Sinclair, Dr Agnieszka Konopka, Dr Anastasia Klimovich-Gray, Dr Nika Adamian. Funders: Aberdeen University, Internal Funding to Pump-Prime Research and Research Networks to all collaborators.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://creativeinformatics.org/research/announcing-the-latest-ci-small-research-grant-holders/">Collaborative Storytelling with an AI Author</a></h3>
      <p>I am really excited that <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/">Chris</a> and I have been awarded a grant to research how creative writers adapt and interact with an AI author. More news to come as we start the project in spring 2022.</p

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>Storytelling is an area where humans excel, using creativity and communication skills to pass on histories, introspect, entertain, and connect with others. This project will investigate whether and to what extent Neural Language Models can be useful collaborative tools for writers creating short stories. As part of this investigation, we are interested in exploiting the ability of NLMs to be fine-tuned to specific examples of language, and creating several potential characters with which our human authors can interact.</i></p>
