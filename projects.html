    <h3><a href="https://creativeinformatics.org/research/announcing-the-latest-ci-small-research-grant-holders/">Collaborative Storytelling with an AI Author</a></h3>
      <p>I am really excited that Chris and I have been awarded a grant to research how creative writers adapt and interact with an AI author. More news to come as we start the project in spring 2022.</p
      <p><i>Storytelling is an area where humans excel, using creativity and communication skills to pass on histories, introspect, entertain, and connect with others. This project will investigate whether and to what extent Neural Language Models can be useful collaborative tools for writers creating short stories. As part of this investigation, we are interested in exploiting the ability of NLMs to be fine-tuned to specific examples of language, and creating several potential characters with which our human authors can interact.</i></p>

      <p>If you are interested in getting involved with this project, and are a creative writer (short stories, poetry, and screenplays count) who is keen to write short stories with an AI author, please enter your details <a href="https://forms.gle/xA9WvoFZibYyJzrc8">here</a> and we will get in touch with you.</p>
